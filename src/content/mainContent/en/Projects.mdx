In my previous job at Proventic, I developed more than 15 Zendesk JS/React apps and Zendesk themes,
which has been to the great satisfaction of both customers and users.

<br />
Some apps were developed for companies and are installed privately in their Zendesk.
But most of the apps I developed were published in the Zendesk Marketplace.
[Here you can see the Zendesk apps published by Proventic](https://www.zendesk.com/marketplace/partners/5189/proventic-aps/) (scroll past all text for apps).

<br />
I developed the help center website for Roskilde Festival [which can be found here.](https://faq.roskilde-festival.dk/hc/en-gb)
