In my previous job at Proventic, I developed more than 15 Zendesk JS/React apps and Zendesk themes,
which has been to the great satisfaction of both customers and users.

<br />
Some apps were developed for companies and are installed privately in their Zendesk.
But most of the apps I developed were published in the Zendesk Marketplace.
