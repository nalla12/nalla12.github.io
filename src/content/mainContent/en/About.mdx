### Hello! I'm Allan Duong, a passionate web developer, focusing primarily on front-end and UI/UX design with a good sense of aesthetics and usability
\
My core skills are modern front-end web development with React, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML and CSS. I also have experience working with Node.js and Express.js backend.
I keep my code dry and clean, but with nice UI design, which is user-friendly, responsive and intuitive to use without unnecessary clicks.
